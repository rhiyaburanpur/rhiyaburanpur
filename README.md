### AI and Deep Learning

#### PDF2Quiz: AI-Powered Question Generator (Local LLM)

A document analysis and quiz generation tool built with **Streamlit** and powered by a **local Hugging Face Large Language Model (LLM)**. This application instantly generates high-quality, contextual **Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs)** from various document formats.

| Category | Technology | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **App Framework** | Streamlit | Frontend and application interface. |
| **AI Backend** | Hugging Face Transformers | Manages the sequence-to-sequence model locally. |
| **LLM Model** | `facebook/bart-large-cnn` | Generates structured text output (questions, options). |
| **Document Parsing** | PyPDF2, python-docx, python-pptx | Multi-Format Support (PDF, DOCX, PPTX). |

* **Key Feature:** Operates entirely **locally** (zero-cost, no API key required) after the initial model download.
* **Modes:** Supports **Learning Mode** (immediate feedback) and **Practice Mode** (timed assessment).

### Core Development and Systems

#### Go Web Crawler Core (Phase 1)

The sequential core for an efficient web crawler, built on the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** principle. This phase implements the foundational data structures and logic in Go to perform BFS traversal, ensure URL uniqueness, and handle basic fetching and parsing.

| Component | Status | Location | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core BFS Logic** | Complete | `main.go` | Sequential Breadth-First Search loop. |
| **Data Structures** | Complete | `internal/crawler/` | Thread-safe URLQueue and VisitedSet. |
| **HTTP Client** | Complete | `internal/client/http.go` | Custom client with sensible timeouts. |
| **CI Workflow** | Implemented | `.github/workflows/go.yml` | Automatic build and test validation on commit. |

* **Next Step:** Phase 2 will introduce Goroutines and Channels for concurrency.

### Scripting and Utilities

#### IQ Quiz Game (Python)

A simple, command-line **Python** quiz designed to test logical reasoning and general knowledge with 10 challenging questions.

* **Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer. Final score includes a personalised performance message.
* **Technology:** Pure Python scripting.

#### Simple GIF Maker (Python)

A user-friendly **Python script** using the `imageio` library to quickly convert a series of images into a single animated GIF.

* **Customisation:** Easily change duration (speed), output file name, and loop settings.
* **Technology:** Python, `imageio` library.
